Case Scenario: Building a Predictive Model for COVID-19 Trends
The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged public health systems worldwide, making it difficult to predict the virus's spread and understand the key factors influencing transmission and patient outcomes. As a student researcher, I was tasked with developing a predictive modeling system as part of a capstone project for Data Science in the 3MTT Program.
Using historical COVID-19 data provided, the goal was to clean and analyze the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models to forecast trends such as case numbers, hospitalization rates, and recovery times. The project aimed to provide actionable insights that could inform policy decisions, anticipate future outbreaks, and optimize resource allocation for better public health responses.
